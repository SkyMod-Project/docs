# SkyMod

:::danger

SkyMod is still in development and does not contain most features.

:::

SkyMod is a project working on making Scratch even faster than TurboWarp. The first 1-3 versions will be based on TurboWarp with no performance improvement. Versions 3-5 will either use a C++ backend or even compile to C++ and then to Binary.
